            <h4>DIY Drone</h4>
            <p>When I have free time. I would like to start some DIY projects. I recently worked on a DIY drone project. I bought parts and bulit a coustom drone.
            </p>
            <p>The most challenge part for this project was how to reduce electromagnetic interference. I did search and got help from DIY drone commiuties.</p>
            <p>I really enjoy flying drone in the park. </p>
